        <p>
          Hi my name is Rahul, I am currently an undergraduate senior majoring
          in Computer Science. I am going to obtain my bachelors degree this May
          from Queens College. Along with graduating from college, I will also
          be earning a certificate of completion from Columbia Engineering for
          completing the Full Stack Development program that is offered. My
          hobbies include programming, reading, hiking and writing. With
          graduation soon approaching, I hope to land a job in the industry as a
          Full Stack Application Developer.
